Also, although `Executives` tend to have the highest amount borrowed after `Professionals`, until 2013, they had less number of loans completed than `Analysts` who generally borrow less."

    "As a design choice, I have generally used bar charts to compare measures for various dimensions. This is because heights were easier to make sense of as opposed to area, for instance, which is used by tiles.\n",

    "The listings provided in the data for what loans were used for were numbers ranging from 0 to 20. This would not make sense to use as there won't be an approprite legend. This was easily corrected using Tableau's Alias functionality. This allowed me to give an alias to each category in the 'Listings' column.\n",

    "Displaying maps generally provides good aesthetics, and by converting the `Borrower State` column to have geographic role from the `string` data type that it was, I was able to create maps which highlight which state has the highest amount borrowed among all the states in the dataset.\n",

    "- Also enabled filtering over sheet four in the first dashboard. This allows viewers to filter over each `occupation`."
